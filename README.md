# Cashier-iOS-App-
This is a private cashier app and is build for my friend's shop, Keen's Bagelry.

## Git Workflow
Centralized Workflow was used to work directly on the main branch instead of in separate feature branches. This allow prevent extra overhead that isn’t necessary and enable me to skip creating branches. The reason I used this workflow is because I'm working alone and I do not need to code review. However, *Feature Branch Workflow* was also used to when experimental or incomplete code that you aren’t ready to commit to the main branch, which I will commit to a feature branch which is then *rebased* into the main branch
